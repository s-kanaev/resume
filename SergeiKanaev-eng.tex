\section{About myself}
\par{I've had vast experience in:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{C} and \texttt{C++} development for GNU/Linux with CLI and a bit of \texttt{EFL} and \texttt{QT} GUI, including interprocess communications using \texttt{UNIX sockets}, \texttt{pipe}s and a little of \texttt{DBus} IPC;
\item \texttt{bash} shell scripting to run pipelined processes as some sort of daemon with status acquisition, start/stop/restart methods support with per-instance static configuration.
\end{itemize}
\par{I have experience with test-driven development.}
\par{While programming with C++ I've used \texttt{Boost.Asio}, \texttt{STL}, multithreaded and cooperative multitasking.}
\par{Also I've had some experience developing embedded projects with Atmel's 8-bit MCU. These projects were intended to control a set of stepper motors and employed distributed logic to simulate air flow pressures in wind tunnel and simulate liquid flow. For both these projects I've developed both hardware and software.}
\par{I've participated at development of the system to monitor vehicles and theirs telemetry and raise an alarm or notification in case of some event (like fueling, drain, enter/exit geo-zone) with satellite navigation technologies (GPS/GLONASS). This required parsing of GPS/GLONASS trackers' protocols, implementing geo-mathematical algorithms, sensor data filtering, etc.}
\par{At the same time I've had moderate experience with PostgreSQL and SQLite 3 databases in this project.}
\par{I'm interested in studying analogue and digital circuitry and ARM assembly as well as networking protocols and cryptography.}
\par{Also, I was involved in development of application that used multigrids to prepare cartographic data for route-finding algorithms based on graph data structures. There's a a certificate (No 46694) of registration of copyright on the product for this application}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Title:} The computer program ``Raster map images to multigrid converter with subsequent conversion into graph-based data structures''
